# lvk-data

This is a repo I re-use to download and store public data released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.

The data can be found on [GWOSC](https://gwosc.org) and I usually only need parameter-estimation samples, search injections, and population analyses results for the [GWTC releases](https://gwosc.org/eventapi/html/GWTC/).
